We study the problem of testing Unateness. We solve this problem completely for real-valued functions by giving optimal testers for different domains and different type of testers.

A property tester is adaptive if its queries depend on the answers to its previous queries. Otherwise, it is nonadaptive. We prove that adaptivity helps for the unateness testing of real-valued functions. While it does not help for a large class of similar properties including monotonicity.
